This program calculates the photon internal statistics of a two-band 'semiconductor-like' markovian multimode laser with multiple emitters using the Monte-Carlo method.

This program could be used to calculate photon and electron average values variances, spectral density, second-order correlation and bimode stability with lamb factor.

 Documentation for developement is available here : https://crazythutur.github.io/Laser2D/
 For documentation in the algorithm see phd Manuscipt of Arthur Vallet in docs directory
